        <p><b>Narrative,</b> Themes.<br> Finally alone, the machine is able to rest from the constant activity of its user. In its sleep, it dreams aloud, perhaps of electric sheep and at last, the ma-chine enters into a state of bliss. Then it jolts back into function when confronted by the user, suddenly being expected to perform like it usually does. But it can’t for it just awoke and, still tired, the machine slowly enters into a state of malfunction. Perhaps we should just let our machines rest a little more. Or perhaps we should learn to be less harsher on them, as it’s simply in a state where it can’t function properly at the moment. But give it time and it will. In the meantime, just enjoy the show.</p>

        <span></span><b>Purpose,</b> Intended Outcomes.<br>
        <span></span>  Static Haze speculates on how the machine perceives and, in turn, communicates itself once woken up by the user during its state of rest. Blurring the line between function and malfunction, our intent was to aestheticise the latter in order to embrace it’s imperfections; to be delighted and excited as opposed to being frustrated. In the exploration of the machine as this being, we were interested in the transition of states from being asleep to suddenly being woken up as a metaphor to describe our attitudes of the machine. We abruptly bring them to function at will, without thinking about their state of being, yet when they malfunction, we become frustrated at them when, potentially, we only have ourselves to blame.</h4>

        <p>Test pattern presents flickering black and white imagery that floats and convulses in darkness on two screens, one on the floor and another floor to ceiling, in time with a stark, powerful and highly synchronised soundtrack. Through a real–time computer program audio signal patterns are converted into tightly synchronised barcode patterns on the screens. The velocity of the moving images is ultra–fast, some hundreds of frames per second, providing a totally immersive experience for visitors. The work provides a performance test for the audio and visual devices, as well as a response test for one’s perceptions.<span class="small-rule"></span></p>  
        <h4>
    <div class="h4-circle"></div>
        <span></span><b>Precedence,</b> Visual Inspiration.<br>
        <span></span> Ryoji Ikeda, an electronic composer and a visual artist, was our main inspiration for Static Haze. In particular, we looked to his work ‘Test Pattern’ (2008), an audiovisual installation that interprets data and sound into a barcode pattern. Though Ikeda remains relatively quiet as to the purpose of his work, we came to understand Test Pattern as an exploration of the machine transitioning into different states of activities. The idea of states for the machine to transition through then became something that we wanted to explore for Static Haze, taking the experience of Ikeda’s test pattern as a precedent for how our machine should sound and look like when either asleep or awake.</h4>
